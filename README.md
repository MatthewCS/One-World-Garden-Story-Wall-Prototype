# One-World-Garden-Story-Wall-Prototype
A simple project made for Hack Mohawk Valley. None of us are web devs by any stretch of the imagination.


## Objective
Create a database that allows the editing of a databse through a webserver

## Use
The reason we created this was for usage in the One World Garden project. The code can be used to collect stories of refugees and members of our community who might not normally be heard.
